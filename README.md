# Advent Of Code 2021

My solutions to Advent of Code 2021. I may use this year as an opportunity to try out new languages, although I will complete the solutions in Elixir first.

Some languages I am interested in trying

* [Clojure](https://clojure.org/)
* [Roc](https://www.roc-lang.org/)
* [Zig](https://ziglang.org/)
